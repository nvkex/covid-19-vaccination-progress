### The data contains the following information:

**Country**- this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;<br/>
**Country ISO Code** - ISO code for the country;<br/>
**Date** - date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;<br/>
**Total number of vaccinations** - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;<br/>
**Total number of people vaccinated** - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;<br/>
**Total number of people fully vaccinated** - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;<br/>
**Daily vaccinations (raw)** - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;<br/>
**Daily vaccinations** - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;<br/>
**Total vaccinations per hundred** - ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country;<br/>
**Total number of people vaccinated per hundred** - ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country;<br/>
**Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred** - ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country;<br/>
**Number of vaccinations per day** - number of daily vaccination for that day and country;<br/>
**Daily vaccinations per million** - ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country;<br/>
**Vaccines used in the country** - total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date);<br/>
**Source name** - source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.);<br/>
